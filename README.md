# cisco-finesse-gadget-templates

## ABOUT
<p>This project is aimed at modernizing Finesse Development by providing starter templates using the amazing Vite Compiler for three of the most common Javascript frameworks (VanillaJS, VueJS, and React)</p>

<p>No matter which framework you prefer, these will surely help you feel more comfortable developing in ways you're accustomed to.</p>

## WHY DO THESE TEMPLATES EXIST
<p>Finesse has developed a reputation of being old and inflexible. But what most people miss is that Finesse's flexbility gives you the ability to strip it down to an entire single-page application (SPA) if you wanted.</p>

<p>So is it really old and inflexible? Or is it that the examples you've been provided don't let you wonder about a different way of approaching things? Maybe these templates will change your mind.  Who knows, you might find that creating Finesse gadgets becomes a bit less tedious (and dare we say "fun again!")</p>
